## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Lence, a motivated data scientist student with a strong desire to learn, currently building foundational skills in Python, statistics, and data analysis. 
I'm eager to apply my learning in real-world scenarios, gain practical experience, and contribute to solving data-driven challenges.
